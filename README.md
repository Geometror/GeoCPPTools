# GeoCPPTools

A small extension to improve the C++ workflow in VS Code

## Features

- Create a C++ class (header and source file in the same directory)
- ***[EXPERIMENTAL]*** Automatically adjust include directive paths after moving or renaming files
    Moving several folders and/or files at once is supported!
    
    Restrictions:   
    - Only one source directory is currently supported
    - Only recommended for small projects since it uses rather inefficient methods
